"Does RAID replace backups?","NO ❌ — RAID provides redundancy/uptime. Backups protect against deletion, ransomware, disasters"
"Hardware RAID vs Software RAID?","Hardware: dedicated controller card, faster, supports hot-swap. Software: OS-based, cheaper, slower"
"What is hot-swapping in RAID?","Replacing a failed disk WITHOUT shutting down the OS — common in hardware RAID"
"What does the OS see in any RAID array?","One single logical drive — the array appears as one volume regardless of physical disk count"
"What must be true about disks in a RAID array?","Identical capacity, type, and performance. Smallest disk determines max usable space"
"Before configuring RAID, what should you do to the disks?","Format the disks / Ensure disks are unformatted or clean"

"Why NOT use RAID 5 with only 2 drives?","RAID 5 requires minimum 3 drives"
"Why NOT use striped volumes for critical data?","Striped volumes = RAID 0 = no protection, one disk fails = all data lost"
"Why NOT use spanned volumes for redundancy?","Spanned volumes have no redundancy — just combine capacity"
"Exam Attack Step 1: What keyword indicates RAID 0?","'Maximum speed' or 'fastest performance' with no mention of protection"
"Exam Attack Step 2: What keyword indicates RAID 1?","'Mirror' or 'protect critical data with only 2 drives'"

"Exam Attack Step 4: What keyword indicates RAID 10?","'Speed AND redundancy' or 'best overall performance and safety'"
"Which RAID loses exactly 1/3 of space to parity with 3 drives?","RAID 5 — 3 drives → 1 drive equivalent used for parity = 33% overhead"
"If asked for redundancy using PARITY specifically, which RAID?","RAID 5 — keyword 'parity' = RAID 5 (not RAID 1 which uses mirroring)"
"What is the visual pattern for RAID 5?","🟢 Green data blocks + 🟡 One yellow parity per row, parity rotates"
"What is the visual pattern for RAID 6?","🟢 Green data + 🟡 Yellow P + 🟠 Orange Q = Two protection blocks per row"
"What is the visual pattern for RAID 10?","🔵 Blue mirror pair + 🟣 Purple mirror pair, no parity blocks, data duplicated"
